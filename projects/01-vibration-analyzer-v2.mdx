# Human Body Vibration Analyzer v2

### Description

Developed for a client, a human body vibration analyzer is an equipment that uses a 3-axis accelerometer to measure vibration intensity on workers for work safety purposes. This was the second iteration of a previous project, redesigned for stability and cost reduction. The first version was revised, changing hardware/firmware architecture and replacing key hardware components, which led to an **80% bill-of-materials cost reduction** and increased the client’s profit margins

### Technical Details

The project consists of a main PCB powered by an **STM32F4** microcontroller that collects high speed accelerometer data stream via SPI interface and processes it using digital filters based on international standards (e.g., ISO, IEC).

The board is battery powered, charges via USB, has flash storage, and a 2.4-inch LCD display (RGB 656 interface) that allows users to use an embedded GUI to configure measurements, view recorded data and manage equipment settings.

I was responsible for designing the entire firmware architecture and developing most of the code, including:

-   GUI development using [**TouchGFX**](https://support.touchgfx.com/docs/introduction/welcome) framework from STMicroelectronics
-   Firmware architecture and development on **FreeRTOS**
-   Accelerometer data collection via **SPI**
-   Battery fuel gauge and charger control via I²C (Texas Instruments ICs)
-   Touch wheel interface (similar to iPod) on a separate Texas Instruments microcontroller

Besides that, I helped choosing the main hardware components (microcontroller, flash, RAM, accelerometer, LCD), reviewed EE schematics and PCB board design on Altium Designer, and performed hardware/firmware integration and testing.

### Results

The entire project was developed over the course of one year in 2022 and is currently being manufactured. You can check it out on the [client's website](https://instrutherm.com.br/medidor-de-vibrac-o-de-corpo-humano-com-vmb-e-vci-touch-capacitivo-display-oled-e-certificado-de-calibrac-o-incluso-mod-mv-2000), a leading Brazilian measuring equipment vendor.
