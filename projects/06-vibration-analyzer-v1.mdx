# Human Body Vibration Analyzer v1

### Description

Developed for a client, a human body vibration analyzer is an equipment that uses a 3-axis accelerometer to measure vibration intensity on workers for work safety purposes. This product has two channels, meaning that proccesses data from two 3-axis accelerometers simultaniously.

### Technical Details

The main PCB is powered by a **Colibri iMX7** System-on-Module (SoM) from Toradex, which runs a custom built Linux image. The SoM is connected to a custom carrier board that has a 3.2-inch LCD display, responsible for showing an **embedded Qt GUI** that allows users to configure measurements, view recorded data and manage equipment settings.

The board is battery powered, charges via USB, and stores data on a microSD card. It also has a **STM32 co-processor** that collects high speed accelerometer data stream via SPI interface and processes it using digital filters based on international standards (e.g., ISO, IEC). The collected data is sent to the SoM via **UART** with a custom data protocol.

I was responsible for developing:

* The Qt application in C++ using **Qt Creator** and **Qt Widgets**
* Data reception and processing on the SoM via UART on Linux /dev/tty
* Passing data from the main application to the co-processor through Linux pipes
* Battery fuel gauge and charger control via IÂ²C (Texas Instruments ICs)
* Flash data storage driver on Linux
